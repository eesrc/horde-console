          High fives all around. A new version is out. What does it contain?
          <b>What does it MEAN?</b>
        </tn-p>
        <tn-p>
          Most likely a bunch of bug fixes, but hey, there might be some amazing new features
          incoming as well. Who knows. If you click "Get me new things!" we will fetch the newest
          version. If you were in the middle of something you can delay the update and refresh the
          page later. Your choice!
